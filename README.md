# Mysterious Organism Generator

This project is a part of the Codecademy Front-End Engineer course that I'm currently undertaking. 

The idea is that there's a mysterious organism that some scientists found at the bottom of the ocean that has only 15 DNA bases. In light of this, I had to write different JavaScript functions to calculate and analyze various things about the organism, such as comparing two stands, establishing the probability of the organism's survival, as well as generating more organisms.
